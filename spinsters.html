			<p>As avid cyclists, we were excited by the topic of bikes on campus and set out to interview as many
				bikers as we could. During these discussions, we were able to extract common issues that bikers ran into on campus (such as parking). 
				Through our research, we discovered that many of these issues stemmed from the rental bikes that recently popped up on campus (Spin bikes). Here are a few of the related issues: </p>

			<h1 class="text-center">Initial Design:</h1>
			<p>we decided to base our prototype off of convenience, safety, and space; we identified these values in the process of making the Identity Models, Day in the Life Models, and Personas that we created for our stakeholders</p>
			<p>we managed to think of some potential ideas, including: designated parking spaces and signage in popular Spin parking locations as this seemed 
				most suitable and appropriate to serve the values of our stakeholders; we noticed this while making our storyboards 
				Paying attention to the resolutions of the storyboards involving designated parking spaces, we took	the most common solution and began to formulate ideas for our prototype. 
				This prototype idea would provide Spin bike users convenience since the designated parking spots would be near popular locations. 
				We decided that the designated Spin bike locations would be separate from the personal bike racks. 
				Sharing the space would cause Spin biker users to have to go through several bikes to grab a single Spin bike.</p>
			<p>Ruling out paper and chalk (due to their unreliability), we decided that duct tape was feasible for this prototype. 
				Duct tape was easy to obtain and we did not need a large supply, like we would for paper or chalk. 
				Instead of making a shaded box made of orange duct tape to signify designated parking, the duct tape was used to outline a box where Spin bikes would be placed inside. 
				This idea would be noticeable enough from a distance and the quality would not degrade as fast as the quality of paper or chalk. 
				It would also allow for very nice straights lines to be created to give it that “official” feel. Sketches created throughout our ideation and prototyping process can be found in (Portfolio; Prototype Sketches).</p>

			<h1 class="text-center">Final Design:</h1>
			<p>we made sure that our prototype was near high Spin traffic areas so that more Spin bikers would use it. 
				It would also need to be out of the way of sidewalks and major walkways such that the Spin bikes are not hazardous or cumbersome by blocking pedestrians and bike riders. 
				The prototype would also need to be out of bike racks but still near them. Bike riders dislike when Spin bikes are left in the racks 
				as they do not need to be locked and ultimately end up blocking valuable bike parking spots. 
				And finally, after several iterations, the prototype would need to as close to classrooms as possible. 
				Spin riders used the parking spots near lecture halls much more than the spots near Geisel (library) and many told us that they appreciate a parking spot closer to lecture halls.</p>
			<p>Our final design prototype consisted of a large box of orange tape that would designate a parking area. It was also subtle to not be distracting while maintaining a sense of authority.
				A laminated sign was taped at the base of the box to accurately dictate what the purpose of the box was. After several days of observation, 
				we found our final solution to be quite successful with many people utilizing the designated space.</p>

			<h1 class="text-center">Future Considerations:</h1>
			<p>If we had more time to iterate and implement, we would have liked to create a more permanent solution such as colored bricks or a constructed Spin bike zone. 
				Our design was also intended to be used with an 8-10 foot tall pole to indicate from a further distance where a Spin bike zone was located.</p>
			<p>Spin bikes were a relatively new rental phenomenon on the UCSD campus and while they may have been a problem at the time, the future remained unknown. 
				It would have been immensely helpful to work in collaboration with school administrators to create a more permanent solution that would satisfy 
				all future rental needs as opposed to the solution for just Spin bikes.</p>
